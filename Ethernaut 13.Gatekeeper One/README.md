### Analysis
1) Gateone: A basic intermediary contract will be used to call enter, so that msg.sender != tx.origin.
2) Gatetwo: First I could try to use a debugger to walk through each opcode in an enter transaction and carefully add up the required gas to reach the second gate.But gas costs can be dynamic depending on many situations.so this approach is feasible.
A second approach is to brute force transactions on a local blockchain until we get one that works.
3) Gatethree: Should be concerned with only 8 bytes of it since _gateKey is bytes8 (8 byte size) type. And specifically last 8 bytes of it, since uint conversions retain the last bytes.
As the require,we can deduce the key is bytes8(tx.origin)&0xffffffff0000ffff

        // IGatekeeperOne gate = IGatekeeperOne(_Gate);
        for (uint256 i=0;i<1000;i++){
            // (bool success) = gate.enter{gas: i + (8191 * 3)}(key);

    }
